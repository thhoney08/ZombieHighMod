# ZombieHighMod
A mod for cataclysm: Bright Nights, which sets on a bunker-like school.
In this mod, you are playing as various high-schooler students, who were locked in with a hoard of zombies. But due to some "experiments," the tides have changed and they are locked in with you and your mates.

Gamemod includes:
  Overhaul:
    most of the zombies' stat is rebalanced, so that you could kill with "less armor piercing" weapons
    buffed some items
    re-arranged some maps to get item(s) easliy
    added some professions in other senarios
    weather
    monster groups overhauled
  professions: added 30+ professions, not only in the high school senarios but also others
  items: from clothes to electronics, a lot of items are added. Categories would be:
    clothes
    weapons
      grenades
      improvised weapons
      low-tier weapons in order to train oneself
    electronics
  scenarios: assault on precinct Z is back, and got some new professions
And more!
